This blog is ALL about week 4 of year 9 Computer Science! I hope that you enjoy this blog just as much as the others! 

This week, we extended from last week with a few more key ideas; we, not only talked about the vlookup function and the concatenation function, we looked at decoding messages! 

In last week's blog (vranchy.github.io), I explained how, every time you wanted a new code, you would change the columns used to the column that you wanted to have your message encoded into, however, would it be possible to have an easier way of performing this act? 

Yes, there is. You can use a certain code so that you're able to, with the click of a button, change the columns used. You can do this by, setting to the code to have a box, a single square, where you can change the number, inside it, to set the number of which the letter changes, alphabetically, to reach its encoded message. For example, if you put a '2’ in the box, and ‘A’ was your first message, you would receive, ‘C’. As long as you made your data correctly.

If you don't understand, go back to my previous blogs to try and to help you!

I had another, really informative, great lesson! I can't wait to see what next week will bring!
