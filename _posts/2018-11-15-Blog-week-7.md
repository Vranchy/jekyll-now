Привет,

This is the week after I was ill; week 7! This lesson, we talked about binary!

We made a whole new spreadsheet, where we are going to start doing binary! Sure, we went to a website which had binary on it, and copied+pasted it into the sheets, but, the most important part of this lesson was the discussion; we talked about *what binary actually is*. It is the use of '1's and ‘0’s to make up every letter, number and symbol in existence. We also talked about pixels… How do they know when to do red, blue or green? They recieve a binary code! The table that we put into spreadsheets had what every symbol, letter, number and colour was in binary. 

This lesson was a discussion heavy lesson, however, I really enjoyed it; it was really useful and I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT LESSON!
