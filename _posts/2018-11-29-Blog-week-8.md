Blog week 8

This week was week 8 of our binary term! This week, I was able to FINALLY finish my spreadsheets, I can now successfully de-concatenate a word or phrase, convert each symbol into binary, and concatenate the binary to present it to the user. It took me many, many tries, but I did it. This was a productive and fun week, and I can't wait for the next one!
